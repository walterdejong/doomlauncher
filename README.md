DOOM Launcher
=============

This program is a (simple) launcher for GZDoom. GZDoom uses drag-and-drop
to load custom WADs, which is the dumbest user interface ever.
DOOM Launcher allows you to select any WAD and PK3 files using a file
selector, and then you can launch the game.

Please accept this as my gift to the DOOM community.
